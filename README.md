# 🎮 Number Guessing Game – Java

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, a simple and fun console-based game written in Java. This was built as part of my **CodSoft Java Internship - Task 1**.

## 📌 Description

The game randomly selects a number between 1 and 100. The user is given **7 attempts** to guess the number in each round. After each guess, the program will indicate whether the guess was **too low**, **too high**, or **correct**. Points are awarded based on the number of attempts used.

You can play **multiple rounds**, and your total score will be displayed at the end.
